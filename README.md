RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful technique useful to understand different biological questions, from gene expression and regulation to population genetics and evolution. Usually, the standard protocol begins with the extraction of RNA and its conversion to cDNA in order to be sequenced using high-throughput technologies. The most often used application of RNA-Seq is analyzing differential gene expression (DGE), i.e., comparing the expression of all the genes transcribed under two different conditions. DGE analysis involved three mainly three steps:

1. Map the reads for each sample to the reference genome.
2. Quantify expressed genes and transcripts.
3. Statistical analysis of gene expression.
